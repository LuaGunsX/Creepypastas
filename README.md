# What are creepypastas?
A creepypasta is a horror-related legend which has been shared around the Internet. Creepypasta has since become a catch-all term for any horror content posted onto the Internet. These entries are often brief, user-generated, paranormal stories intended to scare readers. The subject of creepypasta varies widely and can include topics such as ghosts, [murder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LuaGunsX/Creepypastas/main/Beings%20/Jeff%20the%20Killer), [suicide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LuaGunsX/Creepypastas/main/Lost%20Episodes%20/Squidward's%20Suicide), zombies, rituals to summon paranormal entities and [haunted television shows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LuaGunsX/Creepypastas/main/Lost%20Episodes%20/Candle%20Cove) and [video games](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LuaGunsX/Creepypastas/main/Video%20Games%20/BEN%20Drowned). Creepypastas range in length from a single paragraph to lengthy, multi-part series that can span multiple media types.

Copypasta denotes viral, copied and pasted text; this term was coined on 4chan around 2006.

# Types of Creepypasta
## Lost Episodes
Lost episode creepypasta describes supposed television episodes, typically kids' shows, that were either never aired or removed from syndication due to their violent and grotesque content. These supposedly lost episodes often focus on suicide or imply the viewer will suffer great harm. Some lost episode creepypastas focus on local public access shows rather than nationally syndicated shows. Notable examples include Squidward's Suicide, Suicidemouse.avi, Dead Bart, and Max and Ruby 0004. There are, however, actual instances of cartoon episodes being pulled off or banned from broadcast due to the episode's content being inappropriate for kids; for example, a Dexter's Laboratory episode, titled "Rude Removal", was never aired due to the episode featuring severe swearing. Another example is the original version of the [Teletubbies episode "The Bear and the Lion"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LuaGunsX/Creepypastas/main/Lost%20Episodes%20/Teletubbies%20Seesaw), which was pulled off from further broadcast due to criticism for its unsettling cinematography, character design, and music. [A SpongeBob SquarePants episode, titled "SpongeBob in RandomLand", had to re-edit a scene that referred to the Squidward's Suicide creepypasta](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LuaGunsX/Creepypastas/main/Lost%20Episodes%20/Squidward's%20Suicide).
## Video Games
Video game creepypasta focuses on video games containing grotesque or violent content; this content may spill over into the real world and cause the player to harm themselves or others. Many video game creepypastas reveal the conflict to be caused by malevolent entities such as ghosts or artificial intelligence.
## (Blank) the Killer
These creepypastas tell of people, usually a teenager, [becoming a psychopath or killer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LuaGunsX/Creepypastas/main/Beings%20/Jeff%20the%20Killer), often involving a trademark disfigurement due to the effects of a bad childhood, accident, bullying, experiment gone wrong, or supernatural menace. These have since fallen into "clichepastas", because there were probably hundreds if not thousands of them. The first "Blank the Killer" pasta was Jeff the Killer.
## Monsters
These creepypastas involve either supernatural beings or actual legendary, mythical, and folkloristic monsters. One of the famous ones are The Rake.
## Rituals
These creepypastas typically contain instructions on how to perform various entity-summoning rituals, including their do's and don'ts. The main aim of these rituals is to have the ritual doer's wishes realised upon successful completion. Other types of rituals which do not have the effect of granting wishes are often performed for recreation.
