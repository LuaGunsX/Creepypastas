M4 Girl was the name given to a young woman that was found wandering the busy M4 highway, in west England. The "M4 girl" refused to speak, and seemed confused. She was taken to a hospital in Bristol, where, eventually, a couple claiming to be her parents from Devon came and collected the girl, saying they wanted anonymity. To this day, the girls identity, why she wouldn't speak, why her parents remained anonymous and, most importantly, why she was walking a highway 80 miles from home, are unknown.

The pop band Marillion based their concept album "Brave" upon the incident, speculating upon what led to her becoming the M4 Girl. An art-house film based upon the album was released. Both were commercial failures, despite being critically well received.
